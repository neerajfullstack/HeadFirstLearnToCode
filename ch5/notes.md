You already know a lot. Variable and data types and conditionals iteration - that's enough to write basically any program you'd ever want to. 



# No Dumb Questions

# Do I need to define my function before the code calls it? Or can I put my functions at the end of the file?

No

We recommend defining functions at the top of your file for better clarity and organization. 

# local variable

A variable that is declared inside a function or a code block is called a local variable. 

That means you can only refer to that variable inside the body of the code block it is declared in. 

# Scope

Scope is the extent to which your variables are visible. It is an area of the program where you can access a variable, to read or change its value. A global variable is visible everywhere. 

Having to much global variables is not considerd a good thing.
